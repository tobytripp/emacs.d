* Auto-Completion

** Company Mode

   =Company= is an auto-completion library for Emacs.  It has a wide
   variety of back-ends.  See http://company-mode.github.io

     (require-package 'company)
   #+END_SRC

   This =company-quickhelp= package may end up annoying me greatly,
   but I'm giving it a try.  It shows help documentation alongside
   completion entries for those that support it (like elisp).

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require-package 'company-quickhelp)

     (if (require 'company nil 'noerror)
         (progn
           (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'global-company-mode)
           (company-quickhelp-mode 1)
           (setq company-begin-commands '(self-insert-command))))
   #+END_SRC
