* Finding Files

** Projectile
   One important note about =projectile= and =flx=: their matching is
   aggressive.  This is a nice feature most of the time, except when
   you want to open a new file.  They'll eagerly find you some
   file–any file–that matches the name you're trying to enter.  So, to
   turn this off temporarily press: =C-f=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require-package 'projectile)
     (projectile-global-mode)
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-x f") 'projectile-find-file)
     (global-unset-key (kbd "<f4>"))
     (global-set-key (kbd "<f4>") 'projectile-find-file)
   #+END_SRC

** Fuzzy Matching of File and Command Names

   Fuzzy matching is brought in with the =flx= package.
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require-package 'flx-ido)
     (require 'flx-ido)

     (ido-mode 1)
     (ido-everywhere 1)
     (flx-ido-mode 1)
   #+END_SRC

** Open Recent Files

   Enable “Open Recent” and give it a keybinding:
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (recentf-mode 1)
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c f") 'recentf-open-files)
   #+END_SRC


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (provide 'find-file)
#+END_SRC
