* Jira

  I hate it, but people still use it.


** Set-up

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (require-package 'org-jira)

     (make-directory "~/.org-jira" t)
     (setq jiralib-url "https://teamprovi.atlassian.net")
   #+end_src

   Then ~M-x org-jira-get-issues~.


** Queries

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq org-jira-custom-jqls
           '((:jql " project in (MPE) order by created DESC"
                   :limit 100
                   :filename "MPE")))

   #+end_src
